# hugo plugin for Obsidian

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) [plugin](https://docs.obsidian.md/Home) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). There are others, but this is in line with the way that I use both Hugo and Obsidian.

## my workflow

My goal is to write journal entries in Obsidian. Some of them might be chosen to be published on my blog. When this happens, I want the plugin to export a new markdown file to another directory, outside of the Obsidian vault. The new file will have roughly the same content, but a metadata section appropriate for Hugo. Other changes might include the way that images (or "figures") are stored.

## other projects

Before Obsidian, I was using [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) for my writing. I wrote [daypub](https://github.com/samf/daypub) to convert the zip files exported from Day One into my Hugo blog.
